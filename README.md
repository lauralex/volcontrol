# volcontrol

Introducing a simple yet powerful program that allows you to easily change the volume of a specified audio device
directly from your **tray icon**. No need to navigate through complicated settings menus - with a **single click**, you
can adjust the volume to your desired level.

But that's not all - the program also has a unique feature that addresses a
common issue faced by Discord users: audio stuttering. By changing the process affinity of the **audiodg.exe** process to
a _single core_, the program ensures optimal performance for your audio.
